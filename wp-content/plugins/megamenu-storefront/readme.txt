== Description ==

Integrates Max Mega Menu with the WooCommerce StoreFront theme.

Requires Max Mega Menu and StoreFront.

This plugin will add a 'StoreFront' menu theme (designed for a dark StoreFront header background. If you are using a light header background color you will need to update the theme font colors under Mega Menu > Menu Themes).

This plugin will also remove residual styling from contents within mega sub menus.

IMPORTANT: When Max Mega Menu is enabled, the "Primary Menu" menu will be displayed on both desktop and mobiles. The "Handheld Menu" will not be used.
